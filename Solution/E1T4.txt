Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The IAM instance role policy attached to EC2 instances allow full access to all the S3 buckets. This is a poor practice. We should follow least privilge access best practice here and restrict the access to only the required bucket and control the operations that are allowed. 
# Poor practice 2
Web Service is installed in a public subnet with internet gateway enabled. Attacker can gain easy access to the web service instance.
