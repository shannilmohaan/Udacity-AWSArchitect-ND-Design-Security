# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
There are 2 findings on the GuardDuty dashboard related to the unauthorized access to EC2 instance using bruteforce.
This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to SSH services on Linux-based systems. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources.
This finding's severity is low if a brute force attack is aimed at one of your EC2 instances. This finding's severity is high if your EC2 instance is being used to perform the brute force attack.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect anomalies involving the following AWS resource types: IAM Access Keys, EC2 Instances, and S3 Buckets.
VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from Amazon EC2 network interfaces in your VPC. In our case AWS detected the bruteforce attack threat using the VPC flow logs.
