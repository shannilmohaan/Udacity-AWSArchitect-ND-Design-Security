# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1) Currently Load balancer is used to direct traffic to the web application instance. 
2)To reduce the internet facing attack on the web application instance configure the web aplication instance in a private subnet with no internet access.
3) Update the Security Group policy to allow incoming connection only from Load Balanacer IP address on Port 5000
4) Disable access to all other ports.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
VPC Endpoints provide a secure connection to S3 that does not require a gateway or NAT instances.
EC2 instances running in private subnets of a VPC can now have controlled access to S3 buckets, objects, and API functions that are in the same region as the VPC. 
You can use an S3 bucket policy to indicate which VPCs and which VPC Endpoints have access to your S3 buckets.

unless we configure the Web application EC2 instance in a private subnet and edit the S3 bucket policy with the VPC end point access, enabling VPC end points might not prevent unauthorized access completely.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the bucket. The encryption applies only to future uploads.
To change the encryption of an existing object to SSE-KMS, you must re-upload the object. Or, you can copy the object over itself. 

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
It will again create the stack with the original settings. the cloud formation template should be updated to reflect the changes.
